Migrating to v2.0
======================

v2.0 is a big breaking change to this project. Not only is this only a fork now, but with migrating to the new
discord API a lot of changes were necessary.


Python Version Change
-----------------------

In order to make development easier,
the library had to remove support for Python versions lower than 3.8,
which essentially means that **support for Python 3.7, 3.6 and 3.5
is dropped**. We recommend updating to Python version 3.9.
